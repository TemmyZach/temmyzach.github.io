									<p>Hi, my name is Zechariah Ogungbile, a data analyst with a passion for using data-driven insights to create positive change. Born and raised in Ibadan, Nigeria, I developed a strong interest in international relations and public policy from a young age. I pursued this passion by studying Political Science and International Relations at Osun State University, where I graduated with Second Class Honours (Upper Division).</p>
									<p>My final year project titled "CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN NIGERIA: A CASE STUDY OF AMNESTY PROGRAMME IN NIGER DELTA (2007-2011)", exposed me to the importance of data analytics, as I encountered problems with collecting data to support my research. I began my journey into data analytics through self-taught, on platforms like YouTube and other learning apps, with this I was able to gain the basic skills needed to use some analutical tools for the successfully completion of my Bsc research, where I had B grade. The research was commended as one of the most analytical research ever done in the department.</p>
									<p>After my studies, I thought to put my skills into work. I was employed as a PR Executive for Media Arkxess. In this position, I leveraged strategic communication and analytical thinking to amplify client engagement during an unprecedented period of change and crisis. Through innovative content strategies, I drove a 10% increase in key metrics, cementing my ability to translate insights into tangible outcomes. This role gave me little room to put my analytical skills to use, I also felt my skills were still not strong enough, so I decided to join a Data Analytics Bootcamp on Lighthall. This platform taught me how to efficiently utilize analytics tools, such as, Excel, SQL, Power BI, Tableau and Python, to draw meaningful insights from dataset.</p>
									<p>Armed with this life changing experience, I entered the professional world dedicated to applying my skills where they could make the greatest impact. I started my career with a data analytics internship at FJ Aayi International, where I helped optimize marketing strategies through insightful analysis of over one million customer data points. This hands-on experience refined my technical prowess in tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Excel.</p>
									<p>I'm someone who likes to take on meaningful challenges, today, I am a Risk Analyst at Metropolitan Global Resources, where I spearhead risk assessment initiatives across diverse operations. By implementing advanced analytical techniques, I enable more effective decision-making processes and a safer work environment. In my spare time, I remain actively engaged in research consortiums addressing urgent issues facing the Niger Delta region and beyond as the Consortium Secretary (Zone B) of the  GLGEF-AHEF Niger Delta Oil Spillage 2.</p>
									<p>With a proven track record of applying multidisciplinary perspectives to real-world problems, I am primed to take my career to new heights. My commitment to continuous learning and passion for creating positive impact through data will no doubt serve me well on my journey ahead.</p>
